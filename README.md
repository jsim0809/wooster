# Wooster

Wooster is a music analysis project using the Spotify API.

## Design goals

**Fast and snappy.**

I plan to construct a clean, streamlined UI that is a pleasure to use.

**One playlist.**

Whenever I use Spotify, I feel overwhelmed with recommendations, playlists, and random stuff that saps my motivation to actually listen to music. I want to replace that with a single song entry field and 'Play' button.

**Visualization.**

I hope to use D3.js to visualize song data in a beautiful way, and gain a more insight into my music listening habits.

**"I'm tired of this song."**

This is the one feature that Spotify is missing for me -- Pandora's "I'm tired of this song" feature, which benches a song for 30 days if you want to give it a break. I want to reproduce this functionality for Wooster.
