# Wooster

Wooster is a music analysis project using the Spotify API.

## Design goals

**Fast and snappy.**

Wooster features a clean, streamlined UI that is a pleasure to use.

**One playlist.**

Whenever I use Spotify's default player, I feel overwhelmed with recommendations, playlists, and random stuff that saps my motivation to actually listen to music. With Wooster, I replaced that with a single song entry field and 'Play' button.

**Visualization.**

Wooster uses D3.js to visualize song data in a beautiful way.

**"I'm tired of this song."**

This was the one feature that Spotify was missing for me: the "I'm tired of this song" feature — from Pandora — which benches a song for 30 days if I want to give it a break. Wooster brings this functionality to Spotify.
