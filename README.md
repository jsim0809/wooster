# Wooster

Wooster is a music player project using the Spotify API.

## Primary design goals

**Beautiful UI.**

I want to create a UI that's a pleasure to look at and use.

**One playlist.**

Whenever I use Spotify's default player, I feel overwhelmed with recommendations, playlists, and a hundred other options. With Wooster, I want to replace that with a single playlist/radio station that plays a mix of music I already like and new music.

**"I'm tired of this song."**

I want to include a feature to put a song on the shelf for a while if I'm getting tired of it.

**Likes and dislikes.**

I want Wooster to learn my preferences based on my likes and dislikes.

**Data-free.**

Wooster uses the Spotify "Playlists" feature to store and calculate your preferences. I don't keep even a little bit of your data. In fact, I don't even know who you are anymore.
