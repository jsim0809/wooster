# Wooster

Wooster is a music player project using the Spotify API.

## Primary design goals
### (see Projects section for more detailed goals and user stories)

**Beautiful UI.**

I want to create a UI that's a pleasure to look at and use.

**One playlist.**

Whenever I use Spotify's default player, I feel overwhelmed with recommendations, playlists, and other random stuff. With Wooster, I want to replace that with a single 'Play' button with radial options. 

**"I'm tired of this song."**

This was the one feature that Spotify was missing for me: the "I'm tired of this song" feature — from Pandora — which benches a song for a while if I want to give it a break.

**Likes and dislikes.**

I want Wooster to learn my preferences based on my likes and dislikes.

**Woo!**

I want a button that lets me indicate that a song is especially boppin'. This will be stored for later data visualization.

## Stretch design goals

**Select a song.**

I want to add the ability to search for and select a song to play.

**Equalizer.**

I want to create an equalizer to visualize a song as it's playing.

**Data visualization.**

I want to be able to view a representation of my listening data and study my listening trends.

**Immediate listening history.**

I want a way to be able to like or dislike songs that I've just listened to.

**FAQ page.**

I want a page that gives information about the Wooster project.
