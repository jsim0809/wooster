# Wooster

Wooster is a streamlined Spotify music player with data visualization and quality-of-life improvements.

## Design goals

**Fast and snappy**

As much as we love Spotify, there's no denying that the UI has grown slower and more bloated over the years. We stripped out all the nonessentials and constructed a clean UI that is a pleasure to use.

**One playlist**

Spotify inundates you with recommendations, playlists, and random stuff that just saps your groove. Wooster doesn't do any of that. Just hit play: Wooster does the rest.

**Visualization**

Songs come to life with a colorful equalizer. Colors and patterns change according to a song's mood features.

**"I'm tired of this song"**

Pandora users rejoice -- the single best feature of Pandora is now available for Spotify. We know there are songs you love, but just don't want to hear any more of right now. Hit "I'm tired of this song" to bench a song for 30 days.

**Your music listening habits**

Check out your music tastes over time.
